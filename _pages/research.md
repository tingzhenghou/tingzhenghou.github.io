Theoretical calculation tools and high throughput screening methods have played an irreplaceable role in materials chemistry research. By using multiscale and high throughput calculation methods, my research mainly focuses on the key scientific problems related to the interface interaction in energy storage materials.
 
## Interfacial Interactions in Li–S Battery Cathodes
 
The lithium–sulfur (Li–S) battery is a promising high-energy-density storage system. One of the major issues hindering its practical application is the solvation and diffusion of lithium polysulfide intermediates, which in combination with the subsequent paradox reactions is known as the shuttle effect. One widely investigated approach to suppress the shuttle effect is to anchor these intermediates using heteroatom-doped nanocarbon. However, the understanding of the related mechanism is still deficient. I use density functional theory (DFT) to model the interactions between various heteroatoms-doped nanocarbon materials and lithium polysulfides, and propose design rules for the doped carbon. Using the theoretical framework, I systematically quantify the binding energy between nitrogen-, oxygen-, boron-, fluorine-, sulfur-, phosphorous-, and chloride-doped graphene nanoribbons and lithium polysulfides, and its relationship with the electronegativity of the dopants. To further explain the calculated strong dipole–dipole interactions between electron-rich dopants (e.g., pyridinic nitrogen) and polysulfides, I apply the lithium bond theory to reveal the electrostatic origin. In close collaboration with experimentalists, I work on the identification of the lithium bond in Li–S batteries using quantum chemistry and 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This direct comparison between the theatrical predictions and experimental observations enables the development of a quantitative descriptor for the lithium bond strength, which further severs as a predictor of the corresponding electrochemical performance. This work highlights the importance of lithium bond chemistry in regulating the interfacial interactions in Li–S cathodes, which is helpful for the rational design and practical applications of Li–S batteries.
