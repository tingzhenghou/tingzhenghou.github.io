Theoretical calculation tools and high throughput screening methods have played an irreplaceable role in materials chemistry research. By using multiscale and high throughput calculation methods, my research mainly focuses on the key scientific problems related to the interfacial interactions and reactions in energy storage materials.
 
## Interfacial Interactions in Li–S Battery Cathodes
 
The lithium–sulfur (Li–S) battery is a promising high-energy-density storage system. One of the major issues hindering its practical application is the solvation and diffusion of lithium polysulfide intermediates, which in combination with the subsequent paradox reactions is known as the shuttle effect. One widely investigated approach to suppress the shuttle effect is to anchor these intermediates using heteroatom-doped nanocarbon. However, the understanding of the related mechanism is still deficient. I use density functional theory (DFT) to model the interactions between various heteroatoms-doped nanocarbon materials and lithium polysulfides, and propose design rules for the doped carbon. Using the theoretical framework, I systematically quantify the binding energy between nitrogen-, oxygen-, boron-, fluorine-, sulfur-, phosphorous-, and chloride-doped graphene nanoribbons and lithium polysulfides, and its relationship with the electronegativity of the dopants. To further explain the calculated strong dipole–dipole interactions between electron-rich dopants (e.g., pyridinic nitrogen) and polysulfides, I apply the lithium bond theory to reveal the electrostatic origin. In close collaboration with experimentalists, I work on the identification of the lithium bond in Li–S batteries using quantum chemistry and 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This direct comparison between the theatrical predictions and experimental observations enables the development of a quantitative descriptor for the lithium bond strength, which further severs as a predictor of the corresponding electrochemical performance. This work highlights the importance of lithium bond chemistry in regulating the interfacial interactions in Li–S cathodes, which is helpful for the rational design and practical applications of Li–S batteries.

## Additives for Lithium-Ion Battery Electrolytes

There is intense interest in developing new anode materials that store a higher density of lithium. However, an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) of emerging silicon and lithium metal anodes has posing obstacles to their practical applications, due to the large volume expansion of silicon and the dendritic growth of lithium. Electrolyte additives have recently been proposed as an effective approach that significantly enhances the strength and stability of the as-formed SEI film. However, the exact mechanism through which additives alter the electrolyte decomposition and SEI formation process remains unclear. My colleagues and I use classical molecular dynamics, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations to investigate the influence of additives on the solvation structure and reduction behavior of lithium-ion battery electrolytes. Albeit minor species, additives can significantly modify the properties of electrolytes. The aim of this work is to provide mechanistic insights into the critical role of additives in tailoring the Li<sub>+</sub> solvation structure and as-formed protective SEI composition that will aid in the rational design of novel electrolytes. Up to now, I have explored electrolyte additives including fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and the [OS3&reg;](https://silatronix.com/products-os3/){:target="_blank"} family solvent.
