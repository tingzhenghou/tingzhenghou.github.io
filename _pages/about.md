I am Tingzheng Hou (侯廷政), a postdoctoral scholar in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from UC Berkeley in 2021, supervised by [Prof. Kristin A. Persson](https://perssongroup.lbl.gov/). I received an M.S. in Chemical Engineering in 2016 and a B.S in Materials Science and Engineering in 2014 from Tsinghua University, where I conducted research in [Prof. Qiang Zhang](https://www.qianggroup.com/wp/en/home/) (张强) group. 

My research interests include the computational modeling and rational design of novel electrolyte and electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries, lithium–sulfur batteries and lithium metal batteries, and the infrastructure development for high throughput molecular dynamics simulation. I have authored or co-authored 20 refereed research papers with a total citation over 5,000. I am an invited peer reviewer for *Nature Catalysis*, *Chemistry of Materials*, and *RSC Advances*.
