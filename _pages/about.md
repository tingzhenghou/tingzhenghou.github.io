I am Tingzheng Hou (侯廷政), an assistant professor at Institute of Materials Research at Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School. I received a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from UC Berkeley in 2021, supervised by [Prof. Kristin A. Persson](https://perssongroup.lbl.gov/){:target="_blank"}, and continued working there as a postdoctoral scholar until 2022. I received an M.S. in Chemical Engineering in 2016, and a B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering in 2014 from Tsinghua University, where I conducted research in [Prof. Qiang Zhang](https://www.qianggroup.com/wp/en/home/){:target="_blank"} (张强) group. 

My research interests include the computational modeling and rational design of novel energy storage materials, the development of high throughput computational infrastructures, and applying artificial intelligence in materials science. I have authored or co-authored 24 refereed research papers with a total citation of over 6,000. I am an invited peer reviewer for *Nature Catalysis*, *Journal of the American Chemical Society*, *Advanced Functional Materials*, *Chemistry of Materials*, *Research*, *Energy Storage Materials*, *RSC Advances*, *Chinese Chemical Letters*, etc.
