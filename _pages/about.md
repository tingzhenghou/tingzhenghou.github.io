I am Tingzheng Hou (侯廷政), an assistant professor at Institute of Materials Research at Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School. I received my Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from University of California, Berkeley in 2021. Following my doctoral study, I worked as a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley until 2022. I received an M.S. in Chemical Engineering in 2016 and a B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering in 2014 from Tsinghua University. 

My research interests include the computational modeling and rational design of novel energy storage materials, the development of high throughput computational infrastructures, and the application of artificial intelligence in materials research. I have authored or co-authored 27 refereed research papers with a total citation of over 6,800. I am a Young Editorial Board member of *[Energy Materials and Devices](https://www.qianggroup.com/wp/en/home/){:target="_blank"}*, and an invited peer reviewer for *Nature Catalysis*, *Nature Communications*, *Journal of the American Chemical Society*, *Advanced Functional Materials*, etc.
