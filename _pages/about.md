I am Tingzheng Hou (侯廷政). I am a postdoctoral scholar in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from UC Berkeley in 2021, supervised by [Prof. Kristin A. Persson](https://perssongroup.lbl.gov/). I received an M.S. in Chemical Engineering and a B.S in Materials Science and Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2016 and 2014. During my Master's education, I conducted research in [Prof. Qiang Zhang](https://www.qianggroup.com/) (张强) group. 

My research interests include the computational modeling and rational design of novel electrolytes and electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries, lithium–sulfur batteries and lithium metal batteries, and the infrastructure development for high throughput molecular dynamics simulation. I have authored and co-authored 20 refereed publications with a total citation over 5,000. I am a invited peer reviewer of Nature Catalysis, Chemistry of Materials, and RSC Advances.
