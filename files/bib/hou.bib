   abstract = {Despite the extensive employment of binary/ternary mixed-carbonate electrolytes (MCEs) for Li-ion batteries, the role of each ingredient with regards to the solvation structure, transport properties, and reduction behavior is not fully understood. Herein, we report the atomistic modeling and transport property measurements of the Gen2 (1.2 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC)) and EC-base (1.2 M LiPF6 in EC) electrolytes, as well as their mixtures with 10 mol% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). Due to the mixing of cyclic and linear carbonates, the Gen2 electrolyte is found to have a 60% lower ion dissociation rate and a 44% faster Li(+) self-diffusion rate than the EC-base electrolyte, while the total ionic conductivities are similar. Moreover, we propose for the first time the anion-solvent exchange mechanism in MCEs with identified energetic and electrostatic origins. For electrolytes with additive, up to 25% FEC coordinates with Li(+), which exhibits a preferential reduction that helps passivate the anode and facilitates an improved solid electrolyte interphase. The work provides a coherent computational framework for evaluating mixed electrolyte systems.},

   abstract = {We employ tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to study model amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin film anodes galvanostatically cycled for different numbers. For the 13 cycled a-Si, TERS shows good correlation between solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) topography and chemical mapping, corresponding to distribution of lithium ethylene dicarbonate (LEDC) and poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO)-like oligomer species. Subsequent electrochemical cycling makes the SEI relatively thick and rough with the chemical composition heavily dominated by LEDC monomer-dimer for 53 cycled a-Si. For 20x cycled a-Si, the TERS signal is dominated by carboxylate (RCO2Li) compounds of various conformations and fluorinated species (LixPOyFz). A nanomosaic-multilayer hybrid SEI model on top of the a-Si anode is proposed. The significance of this work is applicable not only to silicon, where SEI plays a dominant role in determining the cycle life performance and reversibility, but also for a number of other relevant battery chemistries such as Na-ion and multivalent redox systems.},

   abstract = {Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) has been proposed as an effective electrolyte additive that enhances the stability and elasticity of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) of emerging Si and Li metal anodes. However, uncertainties still remain on the exact mechanism through which FEC alters the electrolyte decomposition and SEI formation process. Herein, the influence of FEC on LiPF6/ethylene carbonate (EC) electrolytes for Si anodes is investigated through classical molecular dynamics, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations. Albeit a minority species, FEC is found to significantly modify the solvation structure and reduction behavior of the electrolyte while being innocuous to transport properties. Even with limited 10% of FEC, the Li+ solvation structure exhibits a notably higher contact-ion pair ratio (14%) than the parent EC electrolyte (6%). Moreover, FEC itself, as a new fluorine-containing species, appears in 1/5 of the Li+ solvation shells. The Li+-coordinated FEC is found to reduce prior to EC and uncoordinated FEC which will passivate the anode surface at an early onset (ca. 0.3 V higher than EC) by forming LiF. The critical role of FEC in tailoring the Li+ solvation structure and as-formed protective SEI composition provides mechanistic insight that will aid in the rational design of novel electrolytes.},

Various lithiophilic conductive frameworks, especially carbon hosts, are used to guide uniform Li nucleation and thus deliver a dendrite-free composite anode. However, the lithiophilic nature of these carbon hosts is poorly understood. Herein, the lithiophilicity chemistry of heteroatom-doped carbon is investigated through both first principles calculations and experimental verifications to guide uniform Li nucleation. The electronegativity, local dipole, and charge transfer are proposed to reveal the lithiophilicity of doping sites. Li bond chemistry further deepens the understanding of lithiophilicity. The O-doped and O/B-co-doped carbons exhibit the best lithiophilicity among single-doped and co-doped carbons, respectively. The excellent lithiophilicity achieved by O-doping carbon is further validated by Li nucleation overpotential measurement. This work uncovers the lithiophilicity chemistry of heteroatom-doped carbons and affords a mechanistic guidance to Li metal anode frameworks for safe rechargeable batteries.},

The strong anchoring of intermediates is widely accepted to retard the shuttle of polysulfides in a working battery. However, the understanding of the intrinsic chemistry is still deficient. Inspired by the concept of hydrogen bond, herein we focus on the Li bond chemistry in Li-S batteries through sophisticated quantum chemical calculations, in combination with (7) Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Identified as Li bond, the strong dipole-dipole interaction between Li polysulfides and Li-S cathode materials originates from the electron-rich donors (e.g., pyridinic nitrogen (pN)), and is enhanced by the inductive and conjugative effect of scaffold materials with pi-electrons (e.g., graphene). The chemical shift of Li polysulfides in (7) Li NMR spectroscopy, being both theoretically predicted and experimentally verified, is suggested to serve as a quantitative descriptor of Li bond strength. These theoretical insights were further proved by actual electrochemical tests. This work highlights the importance of Li bond chemistry in Li-S cell and provides a deep comprehension, which is helpful to the cathode materials rational design and practical applications of Li-S batteries.},

Originated from the slow redox kinetics of polysulfide intermediates, the flood of polysulfides in the batteries during cycling induced low sulfur utilization, severe polarization, low energy efficiency, deteriorated polysulfide shuttle, and short cycling life. Herein, sulfiphilic cobalt disulfide (CoS2) was incorporated into carbon/sulfur cathodes, introducing strong interaction between lithium polysulfides and CoS2 under working conditions. The interfaces between CoS2 and electrolyte served as strong adsorption and activation sites for polar polysulfides and therefore accelerated redox reactions of polysulfides. The high polysulfide reactivity not only guaranteed effective polarization mitigation and promoted energy efficiency by 10% but also promised high discharge capacity and stable cycling performance during 2000 cycles. A slow capacity decay rate of 0.034%/cycle at 2.0 C and a high initial capacity of 1368 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C were achieved. Since the propelling redox reaction is not limited to Li-S system, we foresee the reported strategy herein can be applied in other high-power devices through the systems with controllable redox reactions.},

   abstract = {Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been intensively concerned to fulfill the urgent demands of high capacity energy storage. One of the major unsolved issues is the complex diffusion of lithium polysulfide intermediates, which in combination with the subsequent paradox reactions is known as the shuttle effect. Nanocarbon with homogeneous nonpolar surface served as scaffolding materials in sulfur cathode basically cannot afford a sufficient binding and confining effect to maintain lithium polysulfides within the cathode. Herein, a systematical density functional theory calculation of various heteroatoms-doped nanocarbon materials is conducted to elaborate the mechanism and guide the future screening and rational design of Li-S cathode for better performance. It is proved that the chemical modification using N or O dopant significantly enhances the interaction between the carbon hosts and the polysulfide guests via dipole-dipole electrostatic interaction and thereby effectively prevents shuttle of polysulfides, allowing high capacity and high coulombic efficiency. By contrast, the introduction of B, F, S, P, and Cl monodopants into carbon matrix is unsatisfactory. To achieve the strong-couple effect toward Li2 Sx , the principles for rational design of doped carbon scaffolds in Li-S batteries to achieve a strong electrostatic dipole-dipole interaction are proposed. An implicit volcano plot is obtained to describe the dependence of binding energies on electronegativity of dopants. Moreover, the codoping strategy is predicted to achieve even stronger interfacial interaction to trap lithium polysulfides.},

   abstract = {The use of conductive frameworks as the host scaffold to obtain nanostructured sulfur cathodes is an efficient way to increase the sulfur utilization for redox reaction in Li-S batteries with large discharge capacity and high energy density. However, due to dynamical interfaces driven by phase evolution between the conductive hosts and S-containing guests during cycling, the cathode still faces poor stability. Herein, the use of O-/N-containing nanocarbon as the conductive host sheds a light on the role of the dynamic interface between the carbon host and S-containing guest for a stable Li-S cell. The outstanding reversibility and stability of N-doped C/S cathodes are attributed to the favorable guest-host interaction at the electron-modified interface, manifesting as (i) a chemical gradient to adsorb polar polysulfides and (ii) ameliorative deposition and recharging of Li2S on the region of electron-rich pyridinic N and a graphene domain surrounding quaternary N. Highly reversible, efficient and stable Li storage properties such as mitigated polarization and charge barrier, high capacity of 1370 and 964 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 and 1.0 C, respectively, and 70% of capacity retention after 200 cycles are achieved. Mechanistic insight into the capacity fading inspires the rational design on electrodes for high-performance electrochemical systems.},
